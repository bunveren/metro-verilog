Summary of the logic of the code: With the help of a counter that can count up to 24, it aims to print and wait for each stop within one round of this counter. It will spend the first 20 seconds printing, wait the last 4 seconds (the screen will be cleared), and in the next 20 seconds, it will start printing the name of the next stop based on the information in which direction it is moving.
The first stop and direction are received via switches as desired. The program does not start unless a selection is made. Even after the selection is made, it does not stop or change directions (take inputs from switch) because the project description does not specify how the ending will be.
